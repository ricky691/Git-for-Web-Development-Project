Stretch questions :
1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element? 
Any element can be wrapped within an anchor tag. Block level elements can be converted to inline and inline elements can just as easily be converted to block with the display property in CSS. In general, block level elements are usually structural, while inline elements are usually text based.

    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely?
absolutely positioned is taken out of the flow; thus, other elements are positioned as if it did not exist. The absolutely positioned element is positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width?
 Any overflow value other than visible makes the block it's set on become a BFC. BFCs don't allow descendant floats to escape them, nor do they allow sibling/ancestor floats to intrude into them. The net effect here is that the floated div will do its thing, then the second div will be an ordinary block, taking up all available width except that occupied by the float.
    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
Inline-block,Inline elements.Block-level elements.,<p>
